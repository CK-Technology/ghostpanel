# GhostPanel Next Steps - Portainer Alternative for Bolt

## 🎯 Vision: Modern Portainer Alternative
GhostPanel provides enterprise-grade container management with Bolt's performance advantages - **business and performance first**, with optional specialized workload support.

---

## 📋 Immediate Next Steps (Week 1-2)

### 1. **Bolt API Integration**
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Location**: `archive/ghostpanel/crates/gpanel-core/src/api.rs`
- **Status**: Skeleton exists, needs full implementation
- **Action**: Connect to live Bolt runtime API for real container operations

### 2. **Container CRUD Operations**
- **Priority**: Critical
- **Features**: List, Create, Start, Stop, Delete, Inspect containers
- **Current**: Mock data only
- **Action**: Replace mock services with real Bolt API calls

### 3. **Web UI Data Connection**
- **Priority**: High
- **Location**: `archive/ghostpanel/crates/gpanel-web/src/services/`
- **Current**: Empty service modules
- **Action**: Connect Leptos frontend to agent API endpoints

## 📊 Architecture Status

### ✅ Completed Foundation
```
archive/ghostpanel/
├── crates/
│   ├── gpanel-core/     # Data models, API client
│   ├── gpanel-agent/    # Backend API service
│   ├── gpanel-web/      # Leptos frontend

```

### 🔧 Implementation Gaps
1. **No live Bolt connection** - agent shows mock data
2. **Empty service layer** - frontend can't connect to backend
3. **Placeholder UI pages** - most are basic stubs
4. **No WebSocket updates** - no real-time container status
5. **Missing error handling** - no production-ready error flows

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Week 1-2 Goals
- [ ] Live container list from Bolt runtime
- [ ] Basic start/stop operations working
- [ ] Real-time WebSocket container updates
- [ ] Error handling and user feedback

### Week 3-4 Goals
- [ ] Container creation wizard
- [ ] Container inspection and logs
- [ ] Image management basics
- [ ] Network and volume management

### Month 1 Target
- [ ] Feature parity with basic Portainer functionality
- [ ] Production-ready error handling
- [ ] Authentication and authorization
- [ ] Multi-user support

## 🔗 Integration Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Functionality
```rust
// Connect gpanel-agent to Bolt runtime
let bolt_client = BoltClient::connect("bolt://localhost:8080").await?;

// Implement real container operations
async fn list_containers() -> Result<Vec<Container>> {
    bolt_client.list_containers().await
}
```

### Phase 2: Business Features
- Multi-tenant user management
- Role-based access control
- Resource quotas and limits
- Audit logging and compliance

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- Multi-cluster management
- Advanced monitoring dashboards
- Backup/restore automation
- CI/CD pipeline integration
